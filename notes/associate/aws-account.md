AWS-Accounts: Think of them as **Containers** that include **resources** and **identities**.

When you create an Account you'll have to give them a **UNIQUE** email and a credit card (to pay for bills of resources).

The **account root user** has full permission by default and can't be restricted.

You can include more **identities**, note that **identities** created in X account by default available only in X account.

By default added **identities** don't have any permissions, you have to use IAM to add more permissions.
